## Qualifying Examinations
Qualifying examinations are a kind of certification to engineers - PE in USA, GATE in India

**Note: If you're from another country than USA or India, feel free to add a section relavant to your country's professional certification or equivalent examination. If you're not sure how to do that in Github, send me an [email](mailto:m2n037@gmail.com)**

### GATE for India
[GATE Official Website](www.gate.iitr.ernet.in/)

GATE or [Graduate Aptitute Test in Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering) is a qualifying examination conducted by a consortium of [Indian Institutes of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology) and [Indian Institute of Science Bangalore](http://www.iisc.ac.in/). Even though the official reason to conduct GATE is for post-graduate admissions only, PSUs and Govt. research entities often recruit students on the basis of GATE score.
